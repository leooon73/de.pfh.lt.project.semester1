This is my programme for the Java lecture by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Stefan Wagenpfeil. The program imports a question catalogue as a CSV and processes it.   The user can then choose between the learning mode, which displays the answer after answering the question, and the examination mode, which saves the result in a txt file.
